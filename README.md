## Welcome to my personal blog!

I use this blog to post my personal projects since my freshman year.

In addition to projects, I also put a list of courses I've passed in University of Maryland.

### Projects

#### Sudoku
A Java command line Sudoku solver wrote during the winter break in my sophomore year. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/SiddarGu/Sudoku/blob/master/SudokuSystem.java).

#### Snake Game
A simple snake game wrote during the winter break in my sophomore year. You can find my code [here](https://github.com/SiddarGu/SnakeGame).

#### Tetris
in development

### Courses

#### CMSC131 Object-Oriented Programming I
Introduction to programming and computer science. Emphasizes understanding and implementation of applications using object-oriented techniques. Develops skills such as program design and testing as well as implementation of programs using a graphical IDE. Programming done in Java.

#### CMSC132 Object-Oriented Programming II
Introduction to use of computers to solve problems using software engineering principles. Design, build, test, and debug medium -size software systems and learn to use relevant tools. Use object-oriented methods to create effective and efficient problem solutions. Use and implement application programming interfaces (APIs). Programming done in Java.

#### CMSC216 Introduction to Computer Systems
Introduction to the interaction between user programs and the operating system/hardware. Major topics include C programming, introductory systems programming, and assembly language. Other concepts covered include UNIX, machine data representation, thread management, optimization, and virtual memory. Programming is done in the Linux Environment.

#### CMSC250 Discrete Structures
Fundamental mathematical concepts related to computer science, including finite and infinite sets, relations, functions, and propositional logic. Introduction to other techniques, modeling and solving problems in computer science. Introduction to permutations, combinations, graphs, and trees with selected applications.
Spring 2020

#### CMSC330 Organization of Programming Languages
A study of programming languages, including their syntax, semantics, and implementation. Several different models of languages are discussed, including dynamic, scripting (e.g., Ruby, Python) functional (e.g., OCaml, Haskell, Scheme), and memory safe systems programming (e.g., Rust). Explores language features such as formal syntax, scoping and binding of variables, higher-order programming, typing, and type polymorphism. Introduces finite automata, context free grammar, parsing, lambda calculus, and basics of security attacks and software security.

#### CMSC320 Introduction to Data Science
An introduction to the data science pipeline, i.e., the end-to-end process of going from unstructured, messy data to knowledge and actionable insights. Provides a broad overview of several topics including statistical data analysis, basic data mining and machine learning algorithms, large-scale data management, cloud computing, and information visualization.

#### CMSC351 Algorithms
A systematic study of the complexity of some elementary algorithms related to sorting, graphs and trees, and combinatorics. Algorithms are analyzed using mathematical techniques to solve recurrences and summations.
